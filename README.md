# PalindromeCheckerApp
**Objective

To determine whether a given string is a palindrome using the two-pointer technique in Java.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., madam, racecar, level).

Use Case

This approach is useful when:

You want an efficient solution (O(n) time complexity).

You want to avoid reversing the string.

You want to compare characters from both ends moving inward.

You may need to handle:

Case-insensitive comparisons**
